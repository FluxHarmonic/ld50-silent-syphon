#+title: Silent Syphon - A Ludum Dare 50 Compo Entry

* The Concept

- Top-down space shooter game
- Your ship is running out of energy
- How long can you last until the ship runs out of energy?
- You can siphon energy off of enemy ships
- But you can't siphon off of ships that you destroy!

Name: Silent Syphon

Repo: https://github.com/FluxHarmonic/ld50-silent-syphon

* Development Strategy

- Get basic game mechanics working as fast as possible, it needs to be playable to be an entry!
- After basic game mechanics (movement, shooting, siphoning, enemy spawning, etc) are working, we'll start making sprites for everything, but at low level of quality
- For art, possibly stick with a 16 color palette of (maybe) reds and blues with a green accent
- After basic game loop is working, start adding new features to make it fun

* Tasks

** TODO Get basic player ship rendering and moving using keyboard keys
** TODO Implement basic shooting (bullet particles)
** TODO Add basic enemy spawning
** TODO Add basic enemy AI (shoot at player, have predefined movement pattern)
