#+title: Silent Syphon - A Ludum Dare 50 Compo Entry

The theme for this Ludum Dare is *Delay the Inevitable*!

* Download The Game

You can try out a development builds of the game here:

- *[[https://github.com/FluxHarmonic/ld50-silent-syphon/releases/download/dev/silent-syphon-linux.zip][Linux]]* (tested on Ubuntu 20.04)
- Windows support coming soon!

You will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- OpenGL
- GLFW 3
- libfontconfig
- zlib

If you're on Ubuntu, you can run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

#+begin_src sh

  sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends -y install libglfw3 zlib1g libfontconfig1 mesa-utils libgl1-mesa-glx

#+end_src

** Troubleshooting

If you have issues running the game, first try updating your system in case libraries are out of date.  If you still run into trouble, please [[https://github.com/FluxHarmonic/ld50-silent-syphon/issues][file an issue]]!

* How To Play

The goal of the game is to last as long as you can flying between enemy ships before your ship's energy runs out!

You can gain more energy by siphoning from other ships (*hold J* near another ship) or by collecting energy tank drops from felled ships.

You can also move around and fight back against ships that are in your way, but be aware that these actions cost energy and might make you deplete faster!

If you are killed by the enemies or run out of energy, you will be asked if you want to play again, so *press Y* to boot up a new ship to give it another try.

Here are the controls:

*Movement*

- *W*: Fly forward
- *S*: Fly backward
- *A*: Fly left
- *D*: Fly right

*Actions*

- *J*: Siphon enemy energy
- *K*: Fire weapon

* The Concept

- Top-down space shooter game
- Your ship is running out of energy
- How long can you last until the ship runs out of energy?
- You can siphon energy off of enemy ships
- But you can't siphon off of ships that you destroy!

* Development Strategy

- Get basic game mechanics working as fast as possible, it needs to be playable to be an entry!
- After basic game mechanics (movement, shooting, siphoning, enemy spawning, etc) are working, we'll start making sprites for everything, but at low level of quality
- For art, possibly stick with a 16 color palette of (maybe) reds and blues with a green accent
- After basic game loop is working, start adding new features to make it fun

** TODO Add pickup objects (shield, energy, maybe weapon?)
** TODO Add manual shielding which also depletes
** TODO Tweak configurations of existing enemies
** TODO Maybe add a third enemy?
** TODO Restrict gameplay to the visible area (sans HUD)
** TODO Make basic game sprites
** TODO The graphics look kinda huge on non-hidpi displays
** TODO Add starfield renderer

* Mesche Issues

I need to investigate these issues:

** TODO Heap overflow in a nested =if= -> =begin= in =update-player=, is the chunk too big?
** TODO Circular module reference issues with =syphon player= and =syphon weapon=
** TODO Implement better pattern for updating record field values (pass lambda to mutate)
** TODO Make it possible to set default value for keyword arguments
** TODO Somehow record instances are not initialized correctly when given no keyword args
** TODO Investigate heap overflow with =begin= in =player.msc=
** TODO Investigate heap overflow or bad tail call patching in =update-player='s old incarnation
