#+title: Silent Syphon - A Ludum Dare 50 Compo Entry

The theme for this Ludum Dare is *Delay the Inevitable*!

* Download The Game

You can try out a development builds of the game here:

- *[[https://github.com/FluxHarmonic/ld50-silent-syphon/releases/downloads/dev/silent-syphon-linux.zip][Linux]]* (tested on Ubuntu 20.04)
- Windows support coming soon!

You will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- OpenGL
- GLFW 3
- libfontconfig
- zlib

If you're on Ubuntu, you can run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

#+begin_src sh

  sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends -y install libglfw3 zlib1g libfontconfig1 mesa-utils libgl1-mesa-glx

#+end_src

* The Concept

- Top-down space shooter game
- Your ship is running out of energy
- How long can you last until the ship runs out of energy?
- You can siphon energy off of enemy ships
- But you can't siphon off of ships that you destroy!

Name: Silent Syphon

* Development Strategy

- Get basic game mechanics working as fast as possible, it needs to be playable to be an entry!
- After basic game mechanics (movement, shooting, siphoning, enemy spawning, etc) are working, we'll start making sprites for everything, but at low level of quality
- For art, possibly stick with a 16 color palette of (maybe) reds and blues with a green accent
- After basic game loop is working, start adding new features to make it fun

* Mesche Issues

I need to investigate these issues:

** TODO Heap overflow in a nested =if= -> =begin= in =update-player=, is the chunk too big?
** TODO Circular module reference issues with =syphon player= and =syphon weapon=
